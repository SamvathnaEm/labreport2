#### Which methods in your code are called?

#### What are the relevant arguments to those methods, and the values of any relevant fields of the class?

#### How do the values of any relevant fields of the class change from this specific request? If no values got changed, explain why.

### The path to the public key for your SSH key for logging into ```ieng6``` (within your account on ```ieng6```)

## Part 3
There are a couple of things I learned from the lab in week 3 that I didn't know before. One thing is how to set up the SSH keys for easy access. I can now log onto my remote account again without having to type out the password. I am so glad that I can do that from my computer. I also got introduced to the two new terminal commands, the ```scp``` and ```mkdir``` command. 

```Scp```: copies directories and files from local machine to remote server.<br>
```Mkdir```: allows you to make a new directory.<br>
